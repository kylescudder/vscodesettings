> **0.34.0**: With this release, the integration with VS Live Share has now moved into the core VS Live Share extension! Thanks to everyone who tried it out, and helped make it a core experience for using Live Share.
> 
> The extension now only supports Slack, Discord and Live Share Spaces as chat providers.

# Features

- **Quiet notifications**: Chat apps can be painfully distracting. This extension emphasizes on making chat useful, contextual, and without distracting notifications.
- **Rich formatting**: Share markdown code snippets, and add emojis to your chat messages.
- **Native look-and-feel**: Use chat in your preferred theme and grid editor layout.
